# Mapping_Earthquakes
Using interactive maps with GeoJSON data

## Purpose
The purpose of this activity was to use API keys, GeoJSON and HTML to create interactive maps to view current Earthquakes.  I was also able to add satellite maps, a dark map, technoic places and indicators/keys as to the size and location of earthquakes.
